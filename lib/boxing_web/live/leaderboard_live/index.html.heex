      claimed <a class="underline" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36778932">performance similar to OpenAI's GPT-3.5</a>.

      I thought I'd put that to the test by gamifying a comparison between the two. Here are the results so far:

    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Questions are generated by GPT-4 using this prompt:</li>

      <pre>
        <code>
I'm creating an app that compares large language model completions. Can you write me some prompts I can use to compare them? They should be in a wide range of topics. For example, here are some I have already:

Example outputs:
How are you today?
My wife wants me to pick up some Indian food for dinner. I always get the same things - what should I try?
How much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
What's 3 x 5 / 10 + 9
I really like the novel Anathem by Neal Stephenson. Based on that book, what else might I like?

Can you give me another? Just give me the question. Separate outputs with a \n. Do NOT include numbers in the output. Do NOT start your response with something like "Sure, here are some additional prompts spanning a number of different topics:". Just give me the questions.
        </code>

      <li>
        GPT-3.5 and Llama 2 70B respond to the questions.
        I'm running Llama2 on <.link href="https://replicate.com/replicate/llama70b-v2-chat?utm_campaign=llmboxing&utm_source=project">Replicate</.link>, and GPT on OpenAI's API.
